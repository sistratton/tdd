# Mini-App built using TDD

The allowed values for 'skills' are = `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"d"` or `"e"`

E.g. a string value such as `"aabccdeccabbbe"` will be parsed into groups.

The app was build using `TDD` (Test Driven Development) and red/green refactoring (see Unit Tests). With the Mockito library used for Mocks.

A 'Domain' test (sometimes called 'component' or even 'integration' tests) has also been created.
